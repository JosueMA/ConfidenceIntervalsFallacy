Skepticism about the usefulness of confidence intervals arose as soon as Neyman first articulated the theory [@Neyman:1934].[^2]\footnote{} In the discussion of [@Neyman:1934], Bowley, pointing out what we call the fundamental confidence fallacy, expressed skepticism that the confidence interval answers the right question: 

[^2]: Neyman first articulated the theory in another paper before his major theoretical paper in 1937.

> "I am not at all sure that the 'confidence' is not a 'confidence trick.' Does it really lead us towards what we need -- the chance that in the universe which we are sampling the [parameter] is within these certain limits? I think it does not. I think we are in the position of knowing that either an improbable event has occurred or the [parameter] in the population is within the limits. To balance these things we must make an estimate and form a judgment as to the likelihood of the [parameter] in the universe [that is, a prior probability] -- the very thing that is supposed to be eliminated." (discussion of Neyman, 1934, p. 609)

In the same discussion, Fisher critiqued the theory for possibly leading to mutually contradictory inferences: "The [theory of confidence intervals] was a wide and very handsome one, but it had been erected at considerable expense, and it was perhaps as well to count the cost. The first item to which he [Fisher] would call attention was the loss of uniqueness in the result, and the consequent danger of apparently contradictory inferences." (discussion of Neyman, 1934, p. 618; see also @Fisher:1935a). Though, as we will see, the critiques are accurate, in a broader sense they missed the mark. Like modern proponents of confidence intervals, the critics failed to understand that Neyman's goal was different from theirs: Neyman had developed a behavioral theory designed to control error rates, not a theory for reasoning from data [@Neyman:1941].

In spite of the critiques, confidence intervals have grown in popularity to be the most widely used interval estimators. The alternatives &mdash; such as Bayesian credible intervals and Fisher's fiducial intervals &mdash; are not as commonly used. We suggest that this is largely because people do not understand the differences between confidence interval, Bayesian, and fiducial theories, and how the resulting intervals cannot be interpreted in the same way. In the next section, we will demonstrate the logic of confidence interval theory by building several confidence procedures and comparing them to one another. We will also show how the three fallacies affect inferences with these intervals.
